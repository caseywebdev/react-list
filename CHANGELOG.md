# Changelog

## 0.8.6
- Add `minSize` prop to ensure a list is always at least `minSize` elements
  large.

## 0.8.5
- Use `prop-types` package instead of `React.PropTypes`.

## 0.8.4
- Non-`uniform` type lists with a `window` scroll parent will no longer render
  an initial page unless they are visible in the viewport. (#143)

## 0.8.3
- Use `setTimeout` to detect stack overflow.

## 0.8.2
- Fix issue with misconfiguration detection. (#160)

## 0.8.1
- Provide an error message if the list reaches an unstable state due to
  misconfiguration. (#156, #157)

## 0.8.0
- Dramatically reduced the number of `setState` calls which should yield better
  performance.
- Because of the reduced `setState` calls, the shallow equality check in
  `shouldComponentUpdate` has been removed which should lead to less confusion
  when attempting to re-render list items.
- No changes should need to be made by component consumers, but I've bumped the
  minor version because the `shouldComponentUpdate` change is significant.
